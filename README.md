# Health Arc

A Foundry VTT module that visually displays dynamic arcs around tokens to represent current hit points (HP) and temporary hit points.

## Features

- **HP Arc**: A coloured arc appears around each token to indicate its current HP.
- **Temp HP Arc**: A separate arc is shown for any temporary hit points.
- **Visibility for Non-Owners**: Players who do not own the token and non-GMsâ€”will see a "fuzzed" HP arc. The level of uncertainty decreases with higher passive perception.
- **Fade Out Effect**: When tokens are not in combat, not hovered over, or not selected, their health arcs fade out for a cleaner display.
